### Component Overview

- **Intelligent Router**: Determines optimal storage tier based on file characteristics including size, access frequency, privacy requirements, and cost constraints.
- **Storage Manager**: Handles all upload, download, and migration operations across different storage providers with automatic retry and error handling.
- **Analytics Engine**: Tracks access patterns, predicts future usage, and triggers migrations based on data lifecycle policies. 
- **Provider Adapters**: Unified interface to multiple storage backends, abstracting provider-specific APIs and handling authentication.
- **Encryption Service**: Client-side encryption for private data using AES-256-GCM with user-controlled keys.
- **Smart Contracts**: On-chain metadata storage, ownership records, and access control with event logging for audit trails.

## Storage Tiers

### Hot Tier
- Provider: IPFS Pinning
- Use Case: Frequently accessed files
- Access Time: Under 100ms
- Cost: $0.015 per GB per month
- Characteristics: High availability with multi-node replication

### Warm Tier
- Provider: Storj or IPFS with Filecoin
- Use Case: Moderate access patterns
- Access Time: Under 500ms
- Cost: $0.004 per GB per month
- Characteristics: Encrypted, redundant, S3-compatible

### Cold Tier
- Provider: Arweave
- Use Case: Rare access
- Access Time: 1-3 seconds
- Cost: $8 per GB one-time payment
- Characteristics: Permanent storage, immutable

### Archive Tier
- Provider: Arweave
- Use Case: Long-term retention
- Access Time: 1-5 seconds
- Cost: $8 per GB one-time payment
- Characteristics: Write-once, regulatory compliance

## Storage Providers

### IPFS Configuration

IPFS is used for hot tier storage and content addressing. You can run a local IPFS node or use a hosted service.

### Filecoin Configuration

Filecoin is used for warm tier with cryptographic proof of storage. Requires FIL tokens for storage deals.

### Arweave Configuration

Arweave provides permanent storage for cold and archive tiers. Requires one-time payment in AR tokens.

### Storj Configuration

Storj provides encrypted cloud storage with S3 compatibility for warm tier private files.

### Cost Optimization Strategies

**Deduplication**: Identical chunks stored only once across all users, reducing total storage costs by 30-50% for common file types.

**Compression**: Automatic compression for text and structured data before storage, typically 60-80% size reduction.

**Smart Caching**: Local and edge caching reduces retrieval costs by 90% for frequently accessed files.

**Batch Operations**: Batching uploads and migrations reduces transaction fees by 70%.

**Lifecycle Policies**: Automatic tier transitions optimize costs over file lifetime, typically 80% savings for aging data.

## Migration Strategies

### Access Pattern Based Migration

Files are automatically promoted or demoted based on access frequency:

- Hot to Warm: After 7 days with less than 5 accesses per day
- Warm to Cold: After 30 days with zero access
- Cold to Warm: When access frequency increases above 1 per day
- Warm to Hot: When access frequency increases above 10 per day

### Cost Based Migration

Quarterly cost analysis triggers migrations to optimize spending:

- Evaluate cost per access for each file
- Migrate high-cost low-access files to cheaper tiers
- Promote high-access files if retrieval costs exceed storage savings
- Consolidate fragmented storage across providers

### User Triggered Migration

Users can manually trigger migrations for specific requirements:

- Privacy change: Public to encrypted or vice versa
- Performance boost: Move to hot tier before high-traffic event
- Archive: Move old projects to permanent storage
- Backup: Replicate across multiple providers

### Scheduled Migration

Automated migrations run on configurable schedules:

- Weekly: Analyze new uploads and optimize placement
- Monthly: Review access patterns and adjust tiers
- Quarterly: Cost optimization and provider rebalancing
- Annually: Archive old data and consolidate storage

## Security Considerations

### Encryption

All private files are encrypted client-side using AES-256-GCM before upload. Encryption keys never leave the client device.

### Access Control

Smart contracts enforce access control on-chain. Only wallet owners can retrieve their private files.

### Audit Trail

All storage operations are logged on-chain for complete audit trail and tamper-proof history.

## Performance Optimization

### Caching Strategy

Three-tier caching improves performance:

- L1: In-memory cache for hot data (Redis)
- L2: Local disk cache for warm data
- L3: Edge nodes for public content (CDN)

### Chunking Optimization

Files are chunked based on size and type:

- Small files (under 1MB): Single chunk
- Medium files (1-100MB): 1MB chunks
- Large files (over 100MB): 256KB chunks for parallel upload

### Parallel Operations

Upload and download operations run in parallel:

- Chunk uploads: 5 concurrent chunks
- Multi-provider uploads: 3 concurrent providers
- Downloads: Parallel chunk retrieval
